<p><strong><br />Computation of gross annual value of a let out property</strong></p>
<p><strong>Gross annual value</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;of a property which is let-out throughout the year is determined in the following manner:</span></p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Compute reasonable expected rent of the property (manner of computation is discussed in later part)</span></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Compute actual rent of the property (manner of computation is discussed in later part).</span></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Compute gross annual value (manner of computation is discussed in later part).</span></p>
<p><strong>Computation of reasonable expected rent of a let out property (i.e. step 1)</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reasonable expected rent will be higher of the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Municipal value of the property (*); or</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fair rent of the property (Note 1).</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a property is covered under Rent Control Act, then the reasonable expected rent cannot exceed standard rent (Note 2).</span></p>
<p><strong>(*) Meaning of Municipal Value</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For collection of municipal taxes, local authorities make periodic survey of all buildings in their jurisdiction. Such value determined by the municipal authorities in respect of a property, is called as municipal value of the property.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note 1:</span><strong> Meaning of Fair Rent</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: It is the reasonable expected rent which the property can fetch. It can be determined on the basis of rent fetched by a similar property in the same or similar locality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note 2:</span><strong> Meaning of Standard Rent: It</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the maximum rent which a person can legally recover from his tenant under the Rent Control Act. Standard rent is applicable only in case of properties covered under Rent Control Act.</span></p>
<p><strong>Computation of Gross Annual Value in case of vacant of a property for some time</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the property is let out and was vacant during the whole year or any part of the previous year &amp; owing to such vacancy the actual rent received or receivable is less than the reasonable expected rent then the actual rent so received or receivable (as reduced by the vacant of house) shall be considered to be the GAV (Gross Annual Value) of the property.</span></p>
<p><strong>Expenses allowed to be deducted from GAV of let out property</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following expenses are allowed to be deducted while computing Income from House Property:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deduction of Municipal Tax paid on property by the tax payer. The deduction is allowed only when the taxes are paid it should not be allowed when they are due but not paid &amp; this deduction is also not allowed when municipal tax is borne by the tenant.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deduction u/s 24(a) @ 30% of Net Annual Value (NAV).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deduction u/s 24(b) on account of interest on capital borrowed for the purchase, construction, repair, renewal or reconstruction of property.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In case of let out property, there is no limit for the deduction of interest u/s 24(b).but in case of a self-occupied property deduction allowed is maximum Rs. 200000 or 30000, as the case may be regarding pre &amp; post construction period interest.</span></p>
<p><strong>Pre-construction period</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deduction on account of interest u/s 24(b) is classified in 2 forms i.e., Pre construction period interest &amp; post construction period interest.</span></p>
<p><strong>Post Construction period Interest:&nbsp;</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is the interest pertaining to the relevant year (i.e., the year for which income is being computed)</span></p>
<p><strong>Pre-Construction period Interest</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: It is the period commencing from the borrowing of the loan and ends on earlier of the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Date of Repayment of Loan; or</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">31st March immediately prior to the date of completion of the construction/acquisition of the property.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interest pertaining to pre-construction period is allowed as deduction in 5 annual equal instalments, commencing from the year in which house property is acquired or constructed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, the total deduction allowed u/s 24(b) is 1/5</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;of Interest of pre-construction period (if any) + post construction period interest (if any)</span></p>
<p><strong>Self -Occupied Property</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A self -occupied property means a property which is self-occupied throughout the year by the owner for their residence &amp; is actually not let out during the whole or part of the year. Thus, a property not occupied by the owner for his residence cannot be treated as a self -occupied property. However, there is one exception to this rule. If the following conditions are satisfied, then the property can be treated as self-occupied and the annual value of a property will be &ldquo;Nil&rdquo;, even though the property is not occupied by the owner throughout the year for his residence:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">a) The taxpayer owns a property;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">b) Such property cannot actually be occupied by him owing to his employment, business or profession carried on at any other place and he has to reside at that other place in a building not owned to him;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">c) The property mentioned in (a) above (or part thereof) is not actually let out at any time during the year;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">d) No other benefit is derived from such property.</span></li>
