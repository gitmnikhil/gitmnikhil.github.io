<h1 style="text-align: center;">Conversion of LLP</h1>
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of the Entrepreneurs opting for LLP registration are small businesses that do not foresee any requirement for raising equity funds. However, some of these small businesses may at some point have a requirement to convert to a private limited company due to various reason. Therefore, in this article, we look at whether a LLP can be converted into a private limited company.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
